# Market_Analysis
The notebook where the project was developed can be found above (market_analysis_project.ipynb).

### What Was Done?
A market analysis was conducted using open data on restaurants in Los Angeles. The analysis included data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization to identify trends, evaluate competition, and extract insights relevant to business decision-making.

### Objective
To support potential investors in assessing the feasibility of a high-cost, innovative café concept featuring robotic waiters by understanding local market dynamics and long-term viability beyond the initial novelty.

### Results
- Restaurant Dominance: Over 75% of establishments are classified as restaurants; fast-foods account for 11%, and cafes 4.5%.
- Independent Preference: 62% of businesses are independent, indicating a local preference for non-chain establishments.
- Capacity Trends: Most restaurants have up to 50 seats. Restaurants and bars have the highest average seating (44+ seats), while cafes and bakeries have fewer.
- Location Insights: Streets like W SUNSET BLVD and W PICO BLVD have the highest restaurant concentration, but many streets host only one or two establishments.
- **Strategic Recommendation**: Positioning the café as a small-scale independent restaurant could align better with market trends. The robotic waiter concept can help differentiate in a saturated market.

### Tools & Languages Used:
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Visual Studio Code

### Possible Improvements & Next Steps
- Perform a geospatial analysis to evaluate commercial vs. residential zones.
- Integrate demographic and income data to refine location selection.
- Analyze consumer reviews and ratings for qualitative insights.
- Conduct financial feasibility modeling to support investment decisions.
